      Each node is a professor in Cheriton school of computer science. Each professor belongs to some area. This area is retrieved from CSrankings. 
      Each area is colored using a different color. Students belong to area 'Unknown' and are assigned distinct color.
      The link between two nodes means thhe 2 authors have collaborated in some way. The width of the link is the normalized citations, which is the
      citations divided by number of authors summed across each paper.

      Observations:
      Most of the faculties in different areas are isolated 'silos' within computer science.
